# Orchid style compatible with DEVBOX

Check this out: https://github.com/AskMeAgain/Devbox

Installation files to use with yadm and DevBox. 

## Introduction

These dotfiles originally started for a lighttheme, but after discoving pywal, i started to support multiple themes in this repo alone. So in the future this repo will be moved to a more fitting repository name.

The winter/orchid theme (see screenshots below) is currently fully supported, the other themes not, but will follow in the next 1 or 2 weeks. Cleanup after installation is still not done, but will happen once i have a feature freeze.

After installing these dependencies, enter "change_style.sh winter" in a console to switch to a style.
